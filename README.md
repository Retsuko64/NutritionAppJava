# NutritionAppJava
This is my first project in Java, basically its a Nutrition app.
The user is able to login and check on their diet which the nutritionist set up for them, they are also able to chat with the nutritionist, I also implemented a BMI calculator, the user could also check how much water they had on their day, the user could also state what they ate and the nutritionist will be able to see and would be able to judge whether it was healthy eating or bad.

The chat on the app is TCP based.

In order to store the users, I put them on files called Properties file, which stores information as a Hashmap style. Basically when the app runs the information is loaded into a hashmap, and then would be able to use them as necessary. (Im not familiar with database yet).
